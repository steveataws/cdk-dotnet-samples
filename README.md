# AWS CDK and .NET - breakout session demos and deck content

This repository, used for my [breakout session](https://nicconf.com/events/infrastructure-as-code-with-the-aws-cloud-developer-kit/) at the 2020 Nordic Infrastructure Conference, entitled "Infrastructure as Code with the AWS Cloud Developer Kit" has moved! Please find the code, and other samples, at https://github.com/steveataws/TalkDemos in the 'cdk' folder.
